\chapter{Introduction}
This report takes on some questions about where players playing the computer game League of Legends with different levels of experience focus on the screen, what their priorities are during gameplay and how long they take to finish a round in the game. In hopes of discovering a trend six participants have been eye-tracked while playing one round in the game. The participants will be referred to P1, P2, â€¦ and P6, in order of experience with the game, where P1 has the least experience and P6 has the most.

\section{League of Legends}
League of Legends (LoL) is multiplayer online battle arena (moba) game. By default two teams of five players each, participate with the goal of destroying the base of the opposing team. Each player controls a hero with unique abilities on the battlefield trying to achieve this goal.

The map is split into three different `lanes' where most of the combat occurs, separated by a `jungle', a traversable area with less visibility and many twists and turns. Because of this layout, keeping track of the players on one's own team as well as opponents is important to successful tactics. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a mini-map, a small area in the lower right corner showing a top down view of the area with icons for each players, colored by team.

As the game progresses, each player accumulates gold, the in-game currency, which is meant to be spent in a shop in each team's base to buy items that improves the player's stats for the duration of the game.

\section{Hypothesis and questions}
There is a distinct difference between how new players and experienced players look at the screen to attain information.

\begin{itemize}
\item Does the new players find the shop?
\item Do new players lay less time on the mini-map then experienced players?
\item Can the learning curve for new players be improved without decreasing the enjoyment for experienced players?
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Analysis}
All of the data retrieved from the experiment are visualized using gaze plots and heat maps, and one of each has been generated for each participant in order to find differences. Participants was selected from two different groups in order to make a comparison. Group 1 (P1, P2 and P3) contains players with little to none experience with the game and group 2 (P4, P5, and P6) contains players with plenty of experience. For the group analysis each group have its group members' gaze plots and heat maps combined into a single gaze plot and heat map to help with the analysis.

\section{Group 1 analysis}
P1 and P2 have no experience with moba games and P3 has played about 10 hours. As for this groups' heat map some data can be extracted. They have a great focus on the middle screen where there character are and some focus on the skills in the middle bottom of the screen.  They also lay much more time on the mini-map down to the right. Some of the places they don't look too much on are down to the left, on the character stats, items and how much gold they have. Also there was nearly no focus on info of the other teammates and the game stats.

When it comes to the gaze plots, some patterns can be drawn, they look nearly everywhere. Some places are more attractive than others and a pattern also found are that they goes to the mini-map and then out again.

\section{Group 2 analysis}
P4 have played for about a year time of experience. P5 have about 2 years of experience with this game. P6 have about 3 years of experience with this game. This groups' heat map have 2 great focus spots, in the center and on the first 4 skills in the bottom center. some time are spent on the mini-map and on the items bought. This leads to, experienced players lay great time on the battlefield and the skills and some time on the mini-map and the items.
